# ML-From-Scratch

A collection of **Machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch in Python**.  
All algorithms are manually coded **without using scikit-learn or other ML libraries**.  
Basic Python libraries like `math`, `random`, and `numpy` are used where necessary.

## Features

Examples of implemented algorithms:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Perceptron-Trick
- Gradient Descent 
- Batch Gradient Descent
- Perceptron Loss Funciton
> More algorithms will be added over time.
